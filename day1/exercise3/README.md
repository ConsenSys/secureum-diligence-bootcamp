# Exercise 3: if_succeeds on contracts

So far we have learned about annotations on contracts (`#invariant`), and annotations on functions (`#if_succeeds`).
It turns out however, that you can also use the `if_succeeds` annotation on contracts as well. When you use `if_succeeds` on a contract,
it's the same as adding that `if_succeeds` to every function in the contract. We will use an `if_succeeds` on the contract level for the following exercise.

## Setup

To run this exercise you will need `git`, `node` (version 16.0 or later) and `npm` and `scribble`.
You can install scribble globally by running:

```
npm install -g eth-scribble
```

After you have checked out this repo, you can install the needed packages by running:

```
cd day1/exercise2
npm install
```

## Invariants

In this exercise we will look at an example escrow contract taken from the
[solidity
documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase).

The `Purchase` contract implements a state machine that locks 2x the amounts of
funds necessary for a purchase from both a seller and a buyer, and upon
successful confirmation from the buyer releases the funds appropriately.

Central to the correctness of this contract is that it implements a state machine correctly, and only the
right actor (buyer or seller) can trigger a specific transition. In English, we can state the transitions as follows:

1. We can move into the `Locked` state only from the `Created` state. After moving into the `Locked` state, the `msg.sender` becomes the `buyer`.

2. We can move into the `Release` state only from the `Locked` state. Only the `buyer` can do this move.

Express the above 2 annotations as `#if_succeeds`s on the whole contract. Note that you may need more than 2 annotations to express this.

You should confirm that you can instrument and test your code.

As a second harder task, we have introduced a small bug that should be caught by your annotations, if you write the right test. Can you find it? As a hint, try looking at your annotations, and write tests that should be rejected by your annotations.

## Instrumenting and testing

Instrument the contract as we have shown you before.

```
scribble --arm contracts/Purchase.sol --output-mode files
```

We have added the skeleton of an empty test under `test/Purchase.js`. Write some tests for this contract, and run them using the following command:

```
npx hardhat test
```

## Restoring our code

You can always restore the original code using:

```
scribble --disarm contracts/Purchase.sol --output-mode files
```
